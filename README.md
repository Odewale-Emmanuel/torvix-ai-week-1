# Frontend Developer Internship — Week 1: Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the Week 1 deliverable for the Torvix AI Frontend Developer Internship (13 Oct – 13 Nov 2025): a responsive personal portfolio built with HTML5 and CSS3.

## Overview

**Goal**: build a responsive, accessible portfolio website that showcases your About, Skills, Projects and Contact information. Use modern layout techniques (Flexbox or CSS Grid) and add small interactive touches (smooth scrolling, hover animations).

## Tech

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox / Grid)
- Optional: a small static server for local testing (e.g. Python's http.server)

## Project structure

- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — styles
- `README.md` — this file
- `LICENSE` — project license

## How to view

- Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use "Open File").
- Or serve the folder with a simple HTTP server for correct relative paths (optional):
  - Example: run a static server (Live server) and visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Week 1 Requirements / Roadmap

1. Build the following sections on the page:
   - Header / Navigation
   - About
   - Skills
   - Projects (with links or screenshots)
   - Contact (a simple contact form or mailto link)
2. Layout with Flexbox or CSS Grid; ensure it is responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop.
3. Add accessibility considerations (semantic HTML, alt attributes, focus styles).
4. Bonus (recommended):
   - Smooth scrolling between sections
   - Hover and focus animations for buttons and project cards
   - A simple form validation (HTML5) or visually clear success state
